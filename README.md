# Penance Hunter

Track and visualize your Warhammer 40,000: Darktide penance progress.

This project has two components that work together:

1. **Penance Exporter** - Darktide mod that exports your penance data to CSV
2. **Penance Hunter** - [marimo](https://marimo.io) notebook that visualizes your exported data

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Export Your Penances (In-Game)

1. Install the Penance Exporter mod (see [Installing the Mod](#installing-the-mod) below)
2. Launch Darktide and open the **Penances menu** (required for export to work)
3. Press the export keybind (default: **F9**) or type `/export_penances` in chat
4. Your CSV file is saved to `%APPDATA%/Fatshark/Darktide/penance_exporter/`

### Step 2: View Your Data

**Option A: Use the GitHub hosted notebook (no installation required)**

1. Go to [steakwhistletv.github.io/penance_hunter](https://steakwhistletv.github.io/penance_hunter/)
2. Drop your exported CSV file into the upload area
3. Explore your penance progress
4. All data processing is done locally, no exported data is sent to any external server

**Option B: Run locally with uv & marimo**

```bash
# Run the notebook (dependencies are installed automatically via inline script metadata)
uvx marimo run apps/penance_hunter.py
```

## Installing the Mod

The Penance Exporter mod requires the [Darktide Mod Framework (DMF)](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/8).

If you're new to Darktide modding, follow the [Darktide Mod Framework installation guide](https://dmf-docs.darkti.de/#/installing-mods) first.

### Installing Penance Exporter

1. Download or copy the `penance_exporter` folder from this repository
2. Place it in your Darktide mods folder:
   ```
   %APPDATA%/Fatshark/Darktide/mods/penance_exporter/
   ```
3. Add the mod to your `mod_load_order.txt`:
   ```
   penance_exporter
   ```
4. Launch Darktide - you should see "Penance Exporter loaded" in chat

### Mod Usage

- **Keybind**: Press **F9** while in the Penances menu to export (configurable in mod settings)
- **Chat command**: Type `/export_penances` while in the Penances menu
- **Output location**: `%APPDATA%/Fatshark/Darktide/penance_exporter/`

The exported CSV filename includes your account ID and timestamp, e.g.:
```
12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc_20260118_103938.csv
```
